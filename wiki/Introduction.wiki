#summary Introduction to CTR05Lib

= Introduction =

This Library allows easy configuration and programming of Measurement Computing Counter boards under any .NET Language.

You will still need to read the 9513 datasheet to understand the mode that you need.

= Details =

Currently only Mode "A" and Mode "O" are implemented, but it is very easy to add the other modes.

Use Mode "A" as a simple counter to measure Frequencies.
Use Mode "O" to measure Periods.

I will provide examples in future commits. 

= Contribution =

Please provide feedback and contribute with patches, examples and documentation so all of us will benefit.
